# osx_apps-Yo-Mama
A fun little app that tells random yo mama jokes!

And....this is what happens when you have a few minutes to kill.

Simple little bash script that scrapes a website for your momma jokes.

# note
Will miss sometimes and on curse words it speaks the special characters f*ck!n sh@t! :)  Can be modified to use any of the osx common voices you may have installed.
